# CITY PITCH

The Audience
============

Engineers across Ontario must file environmental noise impact assessment
reports with municipal and provincial governments for planned
residential developments and roadway projects. We aim to help these
engineers who are using outdated software.

The Problem
===========

For the past three decades, many firms have been using STAMSON, software
based on the ORNAMENT model, to calculate their noise levels and
generate their reports. Unfortunately STAMSON has not been under active
development for twenty years. Engineers are forced to use a DOS program
that, today, has many obstacles, disadvantages, and vulnerabilities in a
modern IT infrastructure.

-   DOS program that requires a virtual machine (VM) to run on a modern
    computer.

    -   difficult to install and support

    -   security risk: running outdated operating systems

-   Cumbersome interface

    -   steep learning curve

    -   no mouse support (must cycle through DOS menus)

    -   time-consuming data entry and data editing

-   Only one receiver at a time

    -   must save separate files instead of one project

    -   must "stitch together" several reports into one (requiring other
        tools)

    -   making changes requires ...

        1.  opening and updating a STAMSON file

        2.  recalculating the sound levels

        3.  exporting the report

        4.  repeating this for each receiver

        5.  and finally, recompiling the master report

The Solution
============

Noiiseis a modern reincarnation of STAMSON.

-   Simple Setup

    -   web-based

    -   no VMs

    -   no installation

-   ORNAMENT-based Algorithms

    -   accurate calculations that match STAMSON\*

    -   day-night traffic volume split

    -   traffic growth (rate and years)

    -   topographies (elevation change and barrier)

    -   pavement, finite, and distance adjustments

    -   shielding adjustments

    -   input entry validation

    *... except where STAMSON deviates from ORNAMENT due to
    interpolating tabulated values.*

-   Time Saving

    -   intuitive, spreadsheet-like interface

    -   unlimited receiver locations in one project

    -   reusable segments across the project

    -   unified report for all receiver calculations

Roadmap
=======

We are continually working to make Noiisebetter and more useful,
according to your needs. Here is what is in the pipeline:

-   Save and open project files

-   Enhanced report details

-   Inverse calculation tools

-   Rail (STEAM)

Summary
=======

Noiiseis a modern approach to traffic noise calculations aimed at
helping engineers across Ontario who are still using outdated software.

Noiiseis a reincarnation of STAMSON based on ORNAMENT. Because it uses
the same inputs, users will find the workflow familiar, yet streamlined.
It has an easy-to-use spreadsheet-like layout, and is accessible through
a modern browser, thereby eliminating the security risks associated with
VMs.

With the ability to perform unlimited receiver calculations in a single
project, resulting in a single report, Noiiseeliminates time-consuming
data entry and repetitive work, saving firms time and money.
